# ValueOfBot

A reddit bot that parses comments and converts any currency values to bananas.

Currently, only checking for USD values in the form of $xx, and acting as if $1 = 1 banana.

TO-DO:
 - get current value of a banana
 - add support for other currencies
 - add other fruits?
 - launch the bot on an online server
